# TreeSwing

A team building game going VR. Take a swing at it!

*This is project is based on [Ian Petrarca](https://ianpetrarca.com/)s [A-Frame Boilerplate](https://github.com/ianpetrarca/webvr_boilerplate)*

___
## Installation

    git clone https://github.com/el-X/treeswing.git
    cd treeswing
    npm install

## Development Stage

To spin up a localhost site, run the following command then point a WebVR friendly browser to http://localhost:8088/

    npm run dev

To view the dev server on an external device find out your local IP address (Type 'ipconfig' in any terminal) and view the 8088 port. This may look like:

    192.168.1.165:8088
 
 ## Building 
 
 To build and optimize your HTML/JS run:
     
     npm run build
 
 This will Webpack build your ./src folder into the ./build directory with the specifications made in the _webpack.config.js_ file.
